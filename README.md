# odin-cv

This is a project submission for The Odin Project's Full Stack Javasript path, React Project: CV Application. The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with React, by making modularized components for a fully responsive CV builder app.

It features 5 sections a user can freely customize, complete with delete and update functionality.
